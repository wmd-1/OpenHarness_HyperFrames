"""Worker liveness registration, heartbeat refresh, and lost-task recovery.

This module implements the multi-instance *ownership / reclaim* machinery.
It is deliberately **not** a strict lease/fencing protocol — it is a
heartbeat + Redis-TTL heuristic (design source §11):

* each worker process advertises itself in Redis with a short TTL and refreshes
  it on a timer;
* each worker refreshes the ``heartbeat_at`` column of the tasks it owns;
* a periodic ``recover_lost_tasks`` scan flips ``running`` tasks whose owner is
  no longer advertised AND whose heartbeat has gone stale back to ``retrying``,
  re-enqueueing them exactly once (a single conditional UPDATE serialized by the
  row lock guarantees idempotency — no double-reclaim, no double re-enqueue).

Because it is a heartbeat heuristic rather than a lease, a stale owner can in
rare cases still write a terminal state; the *success guard* (R9, in
``tasks._mark_succeeded``) prevents that write from clobbering a task another
replica has since taken over. See design source §11.7 for the residual risks,
which are explicitly out of scope for normal-crash acceptance.
